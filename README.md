# CPU Pipeline and L1 Data Cache

In this project, our goal is to design the controller to handle cache his and miss, memory stall, and 2-way set associative cache with SRAM controller module. The cache replacement policy is LRU (Least Recently Used). Also, the write policy is write back, and we will check the state of dirty bit.
